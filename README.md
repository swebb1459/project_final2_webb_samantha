I used this site to get my header font for the site. I tried to find something that had some sharp edges and was a bit condensed.


## Comments

Unfortunately, I was confused about my dates as I thought this assignment was due next week. For some reason I was off by a week and unfortunately realized I missed presentation night.

This assignment was interesting. I enjoyed reading about the style tiles and prototypes. I guess it makes sense that with responsive design, you need to be more fluid in the process. I know from experience it is frustrating to receive a design of something and it's not what you want. We are currently redesigning our online bookstore at work and we are at the design part. They put something together and I'm not particularly a fan of the look. I think if they would have done a prototype like this it would have easier to hash out what we want better because now I feel like I'm redesigning the site.

For the actual coding, I had much better luck with the floats and clears. I still need practice as I know I am messing up somewhere when it comes to the margins and/or padding. I definitely messed with the design for the larger displays. I think I changed my mind at least three times as to what I wanted to float where. Having to do a style tile and prototype really makes you think about the general feel even before you code. I tend to jump right in with the structure but not really focus on the design. This will be something I think I will use in the future.
